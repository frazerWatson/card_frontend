#aa Card Frontend

A sweet card frontend made using BEM. For, I dunno, Trackers and such.

Could be a sweet single-page app with some animation.

### How do I use it

Easy-peasy. Get [Browsersync](http://browsersync.io) installed via NPM, and run it. Then head to `localhost:3000` to get it started.

```
npm install -g browser-sync
browser-sync start --server --files "*.html, stylesheets/*.css"
```

### How do I develop it

I'm using [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/) to develop. Install it if you want to use extra goodies. Everything should be provided (no dependencies).

###Â Contributing

Via Pull Request. I'll review manually.
